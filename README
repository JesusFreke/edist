This is a little utility to help verify star coordinates for stars
in Elite: Dangerous. It exhaustively searches the volume of "valid"
coordinates that exactly match the distances available, to ensure that
there is only 1 grid-aligned point in this volume, and that it matches
the coordinate of the star in systems.json

Usage:
python edist.py systems.json

Where systems.json is a file in the format of systems.json
