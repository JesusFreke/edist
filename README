This is a little utility to help calculate and verify star coordinates
for stars in Elite: Dangerous.

It exhaustively searches the volume of "valid" coordinates that exactly
match the distances available, to ensure that there is only 1 grid-aligned
point in this volume, and that it matches the coordinate of the star in
systems.json

Usage for verification of existing coordinates:
python verify.py systems.json

Usage for calculation of new coordinates:
python entry.py systems.json

Where systems.json is a file in the format of systems.json
